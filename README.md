# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System Overview

## Introduction

A Python-based movie recommendation engine using **item-based collaborative filtering** with configurable similarity weighting modes.  
Built with `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `scikit-learn`, this tool predicts movie ratings based on user-item interactions.  
Collaborative filtering is a technique commonly used in recommendation systems, where the system predicts a user's preferences based on the preferences of others.

## Features

- Reads ratings from CSV file (e.g., `ratings.csv` from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/))
- Filters out low-activity users and movies for better recommendation quality
- Supports three prediction modes:
  - **Simple average** of similar item ratings  
  - **Similarity-weighted average**  
  - **User-count-weighted similarity**
- Calculates **MAE**, **Precision**, and **Recall** for evaluation
- Efficient computation using correlation matrices and vectorized operations

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- `numpy` – for numerical operations  
- `pandas` – for data manipulation and processing  
- `scikit-learn` – for model evaluation utilities  
- `scipy` – for scientific computing (optional, depending on environment)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
````

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.
3. Run the main script as shown below to execute the recommender system.

---

## Data

The recommendation system expects a ratings dataset in CSV format containing:

| userId | movieId | rating |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| 1      | 31      | 4.0    |

For this project, the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) was used.
Only movies and users with at least **5 ratings** are retained for better model reliability.

---

## Implementation Details

### Data Initialization

The system reads the ratings file, filters out sparse users and movies, computes the Pearson similarity matrix, and splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.

### Similarity Matrix Calculation

Pearson correlation is used to calculate similarities between items, with a minimum threshold of co-rated users. The matrix is cleaned from zero-correlation entries.

### Item-Item Collaborative Filtering (Mode 1)

Predictions are made by computing the **simple average** of ratings from the k most similar items that a user has rated.

### Weighted Prediction (Mode 2)

The second mode uses **similarity-weighted averages**, giving more weight to closer (higher similarity) items.

### User-Count Weighted Prediction (Mode 3)

This hybrid approach weighs similarities by the **number of users** that rated both items — improving robustness in sparse data situations.

### Metrics Calculation

Three metrics are computed:

* **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
* **Precision** (on binary threshold: rating ≥ 3)
* **Recall**

---

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python recommendation_script.py <path> <neighbors> <train-percentage>
```

### Parameters

* `<path>`: Path to the `ratings.csv` dataset
* `<neighbors>`: Number of similar items (`k`) to use for predictions
* `<train-percentage>`: Fraction of data to be used for training (e.g., `0.8` for 80%)

### Example

```bash
python recommendation_script.py ratings.csv 10 0.9
```

---

## Results

Sample console output:

```
Neighbors: 10
Train split percentage: 0.9

Calculating prediction function 1
MAE: 0.732
Precision: 0.801
Recall: 0.844
Duration: 0:00:41.320000
```

Each mode is evaluated separately and prints its corresponding metrics and duration.

---

## Notes

* Only users and movies with **≥ 5 ratings** are included
* Pearson correlation is used for item similarity
* Ratings are thresholded to binary values (≥3 as positive) for precision/recall
* For meaningful results, use a dataset with sufficient density
